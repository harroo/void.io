## About

void is a cool diep.io inspired space shoot em up i made for fun

the first demo was just flying around (no shooting) but yes mutliplayer 
and all u could do was crash into a couple of planets i placed by hand, 
then i added fighting, and asteroids and upgrades and bots and it got
better and better :D

## How to setup the Project

you will need unity editor 2019.1.9f1 [https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)

and i think thats about it, just clone this repo and open up unity hub
select the voi-project folder from the repo folder and ur good to go!

if you wana try the build script:
it assumes ur unity editor is installed in /opt/Unity/
if its not, make sure it is, or edit the script to the correct paths
